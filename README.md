# ATS_Automation
Key stroke macros to automate tasks in NYC DOE's ATS. 
The tasks in ATS require only keyboard, so with Apple's script editor (we use Macs, long story) can record the key strokes needed to do anything a human can do in ATS. 
The keystrokes can even be recorded in the 3270 emulator using the "Record Macro" function. 
A pretty cheap and easy way to obviate thousands of person-hours of demoralizing busywork per year.
